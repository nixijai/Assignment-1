		<h1>The Internet is Physical??</h1>
		<p><strong>How Does it Work??</strong></p>
		<p>The Internet is a weird and wonderful place which we find ourselves spending hours on end exploring. But what does the internet actually look like? Where does it come from and how do I have access to it from my own flat? . </p>


		<p>Starting from my laptop in my room, I am going to trace back to see where the internet comes and how it ends up on my laptop.</p>

				<h3>My Laptop</h3>
				<p>My Journey into finding what the physical internet starts with the tool I use to search the web. My Laptop. I have spent hours of my life exploring the internet, watching videos, playing games, working and just generally enjoying the technology I am so fortunate enough to have at my fingertips. But the internet doesn't just come with my laptop. No, my laptop has to be connected to the internet whether it is through a Ethernet cable or wirelessly. In my flat we have a modem/router which I connect to wirelessly. Is the Modem/Router the true physical form of the internet? Lets find out.</p>

				<h3>Modem/Router</h3>
				<p>In my flat we have a Wifi modem/router which all four flat memebers connect to. We use it to get wifi on our laptops, phones, PS4's etc. It is essentially what connects us to the rest of the world from inside our flat. But is it the origin of where the internet comes from. Is it the physical form of the internet. No, the modem/router is a device built recieve and the distribute internet to its max range. One router can only distribute internet so far. Our Modem/Router at home is a product of spark who are our internet provider. Could Spark be the physical form of internet.</p>

				<h3>Spark</h3>
				<p>Spark has been our internet provider for the past year that we have lived in the flat. We are currently regisitered under their broadband plan which provides us with unlimited data for a month. If Spark have the ability to give unlimited data monthly to customers all over New Zealand, wouldn't it make sense that they are, or have a machine which is the physical form of the internet. Once again no. Spark is a broadband provider who ,like the modem in my flat, distribute internet but just at a larger level. They do not create the internet themselves. So who do they do this at such a large scale? Cell Towers.</p>

				<h3>Cell Tower</h3>
				<p>Cell Towers are a one of the many ways that internet is distributed around at a large scale. Cell towers use radio signals to connect to devices as far as it can reach. They pass the information from the internet onto to the rest of the country. Cell towers are basically another distributer, but instead of giving the internet straight to our devices, they deliver the information to the companies such as Spark. The cell Towers do have a limited range which is why we can lose rception if we are using devices like our phones in certain locations that don't have strong signals. This was the end of the line for me and unfortunately I was unable to find the true physical form of the internet. But I did learn a lot about the physical forms that help deliver the internet to us, and how if one thing goes wrong with any one of these things, we could lose our internet very easily.  </p>
